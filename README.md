## Continuous Deployment

[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Ã­s the Continuous Deployment system of choice for deploying the applications
that compose the Explorer system and all its dependencies.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrapping a cluster is the process of deploying artifacts for the very first time. ArgoCD itself needs to be deployed the first time
and then, in turn ArgoCD will deploy all the components under its control in a [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) fashion.

An [Application](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_concepts/) In ArgoCD is a:
> A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

Some examples could be: 
1. Microservices and all their resources (workers, network resources, DNS definitions, scaling policies)
2. Databases
3. System / Administration services (metric server etc)

In order to bootstrap the cluster is used the technique of [App of Apps](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/).
